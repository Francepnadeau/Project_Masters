The code for the recurrences from Helene Touzet returns the currect table when we take k=1.
When k=2 however, the table has the correct number of rows and columns but the entries of the table contain too many 0's. At the 
end the total number of words that are accepted by the automoaton is smaller than what we had for the case k=1.
The number of rows of the table correspond to the number of states of DULA(k) and the columns represent the states of Encod(P,k).
We know the number of states of DULA(k) is correct based on the numbers in the paper and the number of states of Encod(P,k) also 
corresponds to the paper.
The agorithm to create the topological order also seems to work. For k=1 we can check that it is correct.
The problem is most likely in the implementation of the recurrences
