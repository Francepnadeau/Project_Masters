Results for k=13 and d=1.
About 10 minutes running time.

Results of the experiment for k=15 and d=1.
About 20 minutes running time.
We are trying to determine the maximal length k that has reasonnable computational time.

For k=17 d=1, about 1 hour running time.

For k=20, running time of abour 3 hours. The file is too big to be supported by github.
