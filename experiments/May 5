The results of experiments for words of length (parameter k) 5 to 10 and distance (parameter d) 1 or 2. We generate all the
words of the specified length k on a binary alphabet.
For each words of length k and distance d we obtain the upperbound given by the recurrences of Myers (which depends only on
k and d and not the actual word), we generate the words according to these recurrences and identify the words that repeat 
and how many times they repeat. We also obtain the prefixes and the exact number of words in the neighborhood for each word
of a specified length given by the method of Touzet.
